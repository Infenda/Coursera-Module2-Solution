        h1.c is known as element with class selector; here element h1 will only get color yellow whereas article remains unaffected
        article > p known as child selector;only when p is direct child of article is affected, other p element remains unaffected and is read from right to left
        article p known as descendant selector;even if p is not a direct child and as long as article remains its ancertor this rule will apply for p element and is read from right to left
        .highlight.mainpoint will affect where both class is called and is used in html using a space in between as'.class="highlight mainpoint" ; we can use many css rules for an element by using space-->
